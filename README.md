 ## About:-
 To create a registration form using HTML and internal CSS:

+ Started with an HTML document and add a form element with input fields for the user's name, email, and password, Gender.
- Applyed the internal CSS to style the form elements, including setting font styles and colors, and adding padding and borders.
+ Uses the label tag to add descriptive text next to each input field.
* Added a Register button to the form using the input tag with type "Register" or if you have already register the go through "Sign Up".
+ At Last Tested the form in a web browser to ensure it works as intended.
